Execute the entire ana-speksi workflow from proposal through implementation
without stopping between phases.

**Input**: The user's description of what they want to build or change.

**Steps**

1. Execute as-new (proposal)
   - After creating proposal.md, set `**Status**: Accepted` (auto-accept)
   - Set `**Generated with**: one-shot` in the header

2. Execute as-storify (functional specs)
   - After creating each functional-spec.md, set `**Status**: Accepted` (auto-accept)
   - Set `**Generated with**: one-shot` in each functional-spec.md and index.md

3. Execute as-techify (research + technical specs)
   - After creating each technical-spec.md, set `**Status**: Accepted` (auto-accept)
   - Set `**Generated with**: one-shot` in each technical-spec.md

4. Execute as-taskify (task creation)
   - After creating each tasks.md, set `**Status**: Accepted` (auto-accept)
   - Set `**Generated with**: one-shot` in each tasks.md

5. Execute as-codify (implementation)

6. Execute as-docufy (archive + truth update)

Follow each phase's skill instructions in sequence. Do not stop between
phases unless an error occurs that requires user intervention.

**Auto-acceptance**: In one-shot mode, all acceptance gates are bypassed
because every document is immediately set to Accepted after creation.
This means no `/as-accept` calls are needed.

**Generated with**: All key documents (proposal.md, functional-spec.md,
technical-spec.md, tasks.md, index.md) must have `**Generated with**: one-shot`
in their headers.

**Index format**: Only four artifact types carry status indicators in
index.md: proposal.md, functional-spec.md, technical-spec.md, tasks.md.
Use `[Accepted]` for these (since they are auto-accepted). All other
files are resources listed without status indicators. Do NOT use checkboxes.

**Extensions**: If during codify you discover critical missing functionality
that is not an iteration of existing tasks but entirely new, create an
extension document using `/as-extend`. In one-shot mode, set
`**Generated with**: one-shot` in the extension and immediately mark it
as `[Implemented]` in index.md after implementing it.

**Guardrails**
- Code changes only during the codify phase
- Each phase must complete fully before the next begins
- If any phase produces results that seem wrong, pause and ask the user
- No emojis in any output or files
