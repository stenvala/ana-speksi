     architecture in the ground truth. Update it whenever truth content
     is added, modified, or reorganized. -->

- [Architecture](platform/architecture.md) -- Overall system architecture

## Features

     Use nested lists for sub-features.
     Each entry gets a short description. -->

- [{feature-name}]({feature-name}/) -- [one-line description]

## Data Models

<!-- List all domain data model files. -->

- [{domain}](data-models/{domain}.md) -- [one-line description]

## Enums
