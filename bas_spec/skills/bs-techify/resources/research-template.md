**Created**: {date}

## Research Objectives

<!-- What questions need to be answered before implementation? -->

## Codebase Analysis

<!-- Findings from analyzing the existing codebase relevant to this change. -->

### Existing Patterns

<!-- What patterns, services, or components already exist that are relevant? -->

### Integration Points

<!-- Where does this change integrate with existing code? -->

## External Research

<!-- Findings from external sources (libraries, APIs, best practices).

     When well-known solutions exist for a problem (e.g., standard validation patterns,
     common algorithms, established API integration approaches), document them here with
     concrete code snippets or configuration examples. This saves implementation time
     and reduces the risk of reinventing the wheel.

     For each known solution found, include:
     - Source/reference (documentation URL, RFC, library docs)
     - Code snippet showing usage in context relevant to this change
     - Any caveats or adaptation needed for our codebase -->

## Third-Party Dependencies

<!-- IMPORTANT: Identify ALL new third-party libraries or services introduced by this change.
     License compliance is critical — non-permissive licenses can block adoption or require payments.

     Preferred license: MIT
     Also acceptable: Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, ISC, Unlicense
     Requires review: MPL-2.0 (weak copyleft — may be acceptable depending on usage)
     NOT accepted: AGPL, GPL, SSPL, BSL, or any license that imposes copyleft obligations
                   or commercial payment requirements

     If multiple libraries solve the same problem, compare them below and prefer the one
     with the most permissive license. Flag any dependency with a problematic license
     as a blocking risk in the Risks section. -->

| Dependency | Purpose | License | Acceptable? | Alternatives |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| | | | | |

### Dependency Alternatives Analysis

<!-- If alternatives exist for any dependency above, provide a comparative analysis
     for each group of alternatives. Copy the template below for each comparison needed.

     This analysis is REQUIRED when the Alternatives column is non-empty. -->
