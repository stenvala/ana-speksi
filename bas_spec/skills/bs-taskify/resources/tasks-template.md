**Status**: Draft
**Generated with**: {generated_with}

## Prerequisites

<!-- List any tasks from other stories or shared infrastructure that must be complete first. -->

## Format

- `[P##.T###]` -- Phase and task identifier (e.g., P01.T001)
- `[P]` -- Can be executed in parallel with other [P] tasks in the same phase
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- Reference the relevant skill for each task
- Only checkbox tasks (`- [ ]`) are tracked for completion and when you implement these, they must be marked as [x]
- Manual verification items are suggestions, not tracked tasks
- **Mandatory to use skills: /skill-name** -- During bs-codify, the agent
  MUST invoke each listed skill (`/skill-name`) BEFORE writing any code
  for that task. This is a blocking requirement.
